                <p>This year has be the worst in my entire life.First there was a pandemic that everywhere to lockdown.Plus school is still going on during it making it more insufferable. Also all the corrupt in the world is now on full display. For instance
                    all racism problem and violent in America. Then you go to the eastern part of the world and China is in conflict with almost every country over land. Can't believe 2020 has been so problematic and confusing. Its like the world is lost
                    and need guidance to help it,</p>
                <p> However we should be thankful that we got to see another year and be apart of history. Also that we are healthy and have our family. Even though 2020 has not be the best year there are still things about the year to be proud about. For
                    example that the most of the world can come together for the racism problem. Plus the quarantine help people to realize how important human interact is for healty.However I don't agree with that I still don't like people. It help people
                    find new hobbies or talents they did know about. As well as aid in making us think more deeply about our thoughts because there is nothing else to do.
